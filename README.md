# ECU-SIMX
CAN ECU BUS SIMULATION

Hello all.
    ECU-SIMX is a tool that is designed to send and receive messages using the CAN protocol for communication between ECU's.
    It comes with an EDB editor, CAN sender , BUS cofiguration and CAN viewer windows in an integrated package as MainMenu.
    It is designed using QML for User Interface and python for it's functionality. 
    We hope it would be useful for those who wants to get into Automotive Electronics.
Thanks to you from team GENX.
